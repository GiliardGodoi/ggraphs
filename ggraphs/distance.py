def shortest_path_dijkstra(graph, source):
    ''' Dijkstra Algorithm: It computes the lowest distance between a source vertice and
    all the other vertices.

    Parameters
        graph : GraphDictionary
        source : <a vertice from the graph>

    Returns
        dist : dict
            <vertice : distance from source> - distance dictionary from the source to vertice
        prev : dict
            < vertice : previous > - a dictionary representing a previous node

    Notes:
        An early implementation has O(n^2) complexity.
        Many improvements has been proposed across the years.
        They are more complicated, though.

        Based in Chirantan Sharma's code
        <https://github.com/cs-oak/Fibonacci-Heaps/blob/master/dijkstra.py>
        Its use an other Priority Queue implemantation which is not used by Sharma.
